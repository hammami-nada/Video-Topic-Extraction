# Video-Topic-Extraction
This project involves the extraction of transcripts and URL information from a dataset containing all TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017. The dataset is a valuable resource for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning research, providing a large amount of text data along with metadata about the talks. This project aims to leverage this dataset for various analyses and machine learning applications.
